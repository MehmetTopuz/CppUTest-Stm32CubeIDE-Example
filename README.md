## STM32CubeIDE CppUTest Example

In this project you can see how CppUTest can be used simply with STM32CubeIDE. For more information on how to do this, you can visit my [blog post](https://mehmettopuz.net/cpputestin-stm32cubeide-ile-kullanimi/.html). 
This project is not a complete unit test example. I plan to share two more blog posts about unit tests, especially TDD. You will see more examples of CppUTest and Stm32CubeIDE in these blog posts and github projects.
